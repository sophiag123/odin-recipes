        <p>There's nothing better than a thin, crispy, pan-fried cutlet of meat, unless that already awesome edible is topped with a rich, savory mushroom Marsala sauce, which takes everything up to a whole new level. By the way, the sauce being discussed
            will take anything up to a whole new level. So even if pan-fried, crispy cutlets aren 't your thing, I hope the sauce makes it into your permanent recipe repertoire.
        </p>
        <p>This unbeatable combination of taste and texture would be fantastic served next to anything, but I highly recommend you go with some version of the simple arugula salad I displayed in the video. The bitter greens, dressed with something acidic,
            really cuts through all that richness and keeps our palate on point until the last bite. But no matter what your serve with yours, I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!
